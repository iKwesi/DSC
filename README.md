tasks @NSU

The home tasks can be found in Home Tasks folder.

In each task there is a build.sh for building the images but in task_2 build_run.sh builds and runs the docker compose file.

kill in task_2 deletes and stops it for running. 

kill_all in task_1 removes all images whether stopped or running.
