tasks @NSU

The home tasks can be found in Home Tasks folder.

In each task there is a build.sh for building the images but in task_2 build_run.sh builds and runs the docker compose file.
## Task 1
Task 1 -> shows how to create and run images and containers using docker.

## Task 2

Task 2 -> shows how docker-compose can be used with a full-stack app and allows different services of the MVC framework to work seamlessly.

kill in task_2 deletes and stops it for running. 

kill_all in task_1 removes all images whether stopped or running.

After running task_2, scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment in the post to see how the node.js app interacts with mongoDB (This shows how different containers or services are run together using docker compose).

Making changes to the separate parts of the code, also reflects because of the volumes links.
